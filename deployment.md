## üåê Live Deployment Options

### **Option 1: Expo Web (Recommended)**
```bash
# Build for web
npx expo export -p web

# Deploy to Vercel
npx vercel --prod

# Deploy to Netlify
npm install -g netlify-cli
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```

### **Option 2: GitHub Pages**
```bash
# Build and deploy
npm run build:web
gh-pages -d dist
```

### **Option 3: Render/Railway**
- Connect GitHub repo
- Set build command: `npx expo export -p web`
- Set publish directory: `dist`

## üì± Mobile Testing (QR Code Fix)

### **Issue:** QR Code not working
**Solution:** Use tunnel mode for mobile testing

```bash
# Start with tunnel (fixes mobile QR scanning)
npx expo start --tunnel

npx expo start --lan
```

### **Mobile Testing Steps:**
1. **Download Expo Go** app on your phone
2. **Connect to same Wi-Fi** as development machine
3. **Scan QR code** from tunnel mode
4. **Alternative:** Enter URL manually in Expo Go
